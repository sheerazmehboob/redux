-> This file structure is recommended by redux-toolkit
-> createSlice uses Immer library under the hood
-> "Slice" should be the suffix of your state file recommended by redux-toolkit
-> Normally we have to combine the reducers if we have multiple states but configureStire do it itself for developers

Steps to create a store:
(I am also mentioning the same steps in cakeSlice.js for better understanding)

    1- Import createSlice method from redux-toolkit
    2- Create a Slice for your state 
        Slice will contain action and reducer of cake state
        This slice accepts an object with 3 properties:
            1- name of slice 
            2- initial State 
            3- reducer function
    3- Define the initial state
    4- Define the reducer mapping
        Reducer is an object in which properties are the switch cases that we have in simple redux app
        Every case accepts a state and action in parameters but in this case we only need state
        createSlice will automatically generate action creator with the same name as we have reducer function
    5- export reducer as default and actions as named export


configure Store:
(Check store.js file for better understanding)
    1- Import configureStore function from redux-toolkit
        configureStore accepts an object as argument. Specify all the reducers from reducer that belongs to features in parameters
    2- export the store

Dispatch an action:
(Check index.js for better understanding)
    1- Import your store
    2- Import the actions of your features
    3- Subscribe the store and you are good to go
    4- Unsubscribe


Adding Middleware:
(npm i redux-logger)
    1- Import reduxLogger to your store.js and use its createLogger function
    2- To Apply middleware we apply use this logger after reducer property in store object like this
            middleware: (getDefaultMiddleware) => getDefaultMiddleware().concat(logger)
                we concat this beacuse by default configureStore apply some middleware
    
Extra Reducers:
    Extra reducers allow us to respond to the events of other states
        For Example: We want to sell an icecream whenever we sell a cake as bonus
    See icecreamSlice.js and with comment "Extra Reducers" for better understanding
